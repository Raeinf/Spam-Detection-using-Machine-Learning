# Spam-Detection-using-Machine-Learning

This project contains a Jupyter notebook that builds a spam detection system using various machine learning models. The notebook guides users through data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation to classify messages as spam or not spam.

## Project Overview

Spam detection is a common text classification problem that involves identifying unsolicited or irrelevant messages. In this project, we apply several machine learning algorithms to classify messages, evaluate each modelâ€™s performance, and compare results based on multiple metrics.

### Models Used

The following machine learning models are implemented and compared in this project:
- **Naive Bayes**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Random Forest**

### Evaluation and Comparison

The models are evaluated based on the following metrics:
- **Accuracy**: Measures the overall correctness of predictions.
- **Precision**: Indicates how many of the predicted spam messages are actually spam.
- **Recall**: Reflects how well the model identifies all spam messages.
- **F1-score**: Provides a harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing both aspects.

These metrics help us assess each model's effectiveness, enabling a comprehensive comparison of their performance.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, nltk

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/spam-detection-ml.git
    ```
2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook main.ipynb
    ```
2. Run the cells step-by-step to preprocess data, train each model, and evaluate performance.

### Results

Each model's results are documented in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, providing insight into their strengths and weaknesses for spam detection.
